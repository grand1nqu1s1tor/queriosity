# Queriosity: Cloud-Based Attribution Q&A Chat Application

**Queriosity** is an innovative cloud-based application that leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enable users to upload academic papers and ask questions directly about the content. Designed for researchers, students, and academics, Queriosity makes scholarly material more accessible by providing immediate, contextual insights.

## 🚀 Features

- **RAG Pipeline**: Utilizes a combination of Retrieval and Generation to provide accurate, context-aware responses to user queries.
- **Attribution**: Ensures transparency by providing citations and references for generated responses.
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Supports various types of content, enhancing the depth of interaction.
- **Semantic Similarity**: Understands and processes user questions based on semantic meaning for improved accuracy.

## ☁️ Cloud-Based Architecture

Queriosity is hosted on **Google Cloud Platform** (GCP) to leverage powerful compute capabilities, scalability, data security, and access to advanced AI tools. This makes Queriosity:

- **Scalable**: Easily adaptable to increasing user demand.
- **Cost-Efficient**: Follows a pay-as-you-go model, minimizing unnecessary costs.
- **Highly Available**: Cloud infrastructure ensures consistent availability.
- **Secure**: Provides advanced security features including identity management and secure access.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend**: ReactJS, HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**Backend**: Node.js, Python

**Cloud Services & Infrastructure**:

- Google App Engine
- Google Cloud Functions
- Google Cloud Endpoints

**Database & Storage**:

- Google Cloud Storage
- Google BigQuery
- Firestore

**Machine Learning & AI**: Google Vertex AI

**Security & Identity Management**:

- Google Identity Platform
- Google Cloud IAM

**Networking & Orchestration**:

- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- VPC

## ⚙️ Architecture Design

The application is built using a modular architecture that integrates Google Cloud services for seamless functionality. It combines compute resources, storage solutions, and machine learning capabilities to deliver an intuitive and efficient experience for end users.

## ❓ How Does Queriosity Stand Out?

- **Attribution Support**: Ensures that all generated responses are backed by proper citations.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines information retrieval with language generation to improve accuracy and reliability.
- **Cloud Scalability and Security**: Leverages Google Cloud for enhanced performance and security.
